	<p>We are asking you to participate in a research study. This form is designed to give you information about this study.  </p>
	<p><b>Project Title:</b> Emotion Detection and Monitoring Using Wearable Devices</p>
	<p><b>Principal Investigator:</b> Rajalakshmi Nandakumar</p>

	<h3> What the study is about </h3>
		The purpose of this study is to understand how physiological signals change when people stay in different emotional states. The study will be used for predicting and monitoring emotions in a variety of contexts, the potential contexts include, monitoring peopleâ€™s emotions in daily life, monitoring the student stress while doing some specific task, learning how a movie clip can influence people's emotions, building an emotion base suggestion system. Data will be collected using iPhone and apple watch. The signals collected using these devices include heart rate, ECG, ambient sound, motion, respiration signals which will all be non-intrusive.

	<h3>What we will ask you to do </h3>

		After the experiment starts, you will be asked to wear a smartwatch, download our MyResearchHub App and watch a few videos through your browser. During this time the physiological signal data include heart rate, ECG, ambient sound, 
		motion, skin temperature, skin conductance, respiration signals will be collected from mobile and wearable devices using app MyResearchHub(an app we built for the data collection on iPhone and Apple Watch). After watching each video clip, you will be asked to complete a part of the questionnaire which asks for your feeling about the video clip. In the end, you need to share the signal data to our server using secure communication channels. 
		
		<h4>Note</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>You can leave the study at any time you want. </li>
			<li>We are not asking any identification information.  </li>
			<li>You can participate in the test at any time and space you preferred </li>
			<li>The data collection procedure will be fully online, no gathering is required </li>
		</ul>

		<h4>Time Estimation</h4>
		Around 30mins in total
		<ul>
			<li>5 mins: Introduction: read the guideline and the procedure and complete the consent form. </li>
			<li>5 mins: Download and install the MyResearchHub App</li>
			<li>15 mins: Data Collection: Repeat the following procedure for about 5 times		
				<ul>
					<li> Watch 3 video clips with the wearable devices on</li>
					<li> Complete questionnaire questions</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>5 mins: upload the questionnaire and the physiological data and uninstall the MyResearchHub app.</li>
		</ul>

	<h3>Risks and discomforts</h3>

		The videos might include political speech and public recognized horror contents that could cause strong emotions. Please undertake this study only if you are comfortable watching these contents and you can discontinue at any time of the study if you are not.

	<h3>Benefits</h3>

		We will give you feedback on your current state and mind and how your results compare to those of other participants. The final results from this experiment will be posted on our webpage. The experiment is not designed to benefit you, but you may enjoy it and enjoy comparing your results with those of other participants. 

	<h3>Payment for participation</h3>

		You will receive a $5 cash incentive through the MTurk platform on completion of the study.

	<h3>Audio/Video Recording</h3>
		
		The audio will be recorded during the experiment. The audio will be used for analyzing ambient noise and breathing patterns. We will not monitor any conversation and apply any language processing algorithm on the audio sample. 
		After this study, the audio sample will be securely encrypted and stored for future research use.

	<h3>Privacy/Confidentiality </h3>
		We will not ask you for your name and any other identifiable details besides MTurk worker ID. The MTurk worker ID will be only used for incentive payment purpose. 
		Any data that we collect will be securely stored on our servers. We anticipate that your participation in this survey presents no greater risk than the everyday use of the Internet.
		To be more specific:

		<ul>
			<li>We are not asking any identification information(except MTurkID for payment purpose) </li>
			<li>The research data will be de-identified.  </li>
			<li>The de-identified files will be stored in the encrypted Cloud file share location, Cornell Box. </li>
			<li>The data could only be access by the team members</li>
		</ul>

	<h3>Data Sharing</h3>
		De-identified data from this study may be shared with the research community at large to advance science and health. We will remove or code any personal information that could identify you before files are shared with other researchers to ensure that, by current scientific standards and known methods, no one will be able to identify you from the information we share. Despite these measures, we cannot guarantee the anonymity of your personal data.

	<h3>Taking part is voluntary </h3>
		The participation of this study is fully voluntary, you may refuse to participate before the study begins, discontinue at any time, or skip any questions/procedures that may make you feel uncomfortable.
